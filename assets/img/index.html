I live in South Wales where I have spent the majority of my life, and though I do love to travel, deep down I would rather be at home. I live near a great beach with the valleys and rivers a 10 min drive away. I love to spend time with my children, whether it's gaming with them, teaching them or travelling together.

Whether it's audio production, video production, or some random tutorials, I would rather learn something new than waste time watching TV. That's not to say I don't watch any TV, though it's usually a series on Netflix or Prime that take's forever to watch because I fall asleep in 5 minutes flat. My current favourites shows are Rick and Morty, The Boys and One Punch Man.</p>
